Ableton Push was a controller released by Ableton in 2013.
It is not a DJing controller, but it offers some pads, buttons, knobs and an LCD screen.
A new version, Push 2, was released in 2015. The Push 2 is not supported by this mapping.

Center pads of the controller are split in 2 sections, Left and Right.
At startup, left half controls Channel 1, and right half controls Channel 2.
You can switch between deck 1&2 and deck 3&4 control using play/record buttons.

For top knobs, touching knobs while Shift button is pressed resets the value by default.
On volume knob, shift changes control from Headphone to Master.

   This mapping is a work in progress.
   You can try it in the current release of Mixxx but it is not yet released.
